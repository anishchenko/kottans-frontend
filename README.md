## **Front-End Basic**

### **1. Intro to HTML and CSS**

I already knew all the topics, but it was useful to repeat the semantic tags and positioning of elements

### **2. Responsive Web Design**

Flexboxes and grids are very interesting and useful topics to use in the project, but in my opinion, these topics are not fully revealed in these two games. I think that I need more practice to better understand them and implement them in the project without problems

### 3. HTML & CSS Practice
[Demo](https://anishchenko.github.io/Html-Css-Popup-Task)
[Repo](https://github.com/anishchenko/Html-Css-Popup-Task)

This task turned out to be **more difficult** than I thought before its implementation. but it gave me more practice with flexboxes, grids and responsive design
